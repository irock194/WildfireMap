Introduction:
The wildfire map application does an API call to get information from NASA to gather information about current wildfires and other natural disasters.
The application stores information about each wildfire into a SQL database. Next, our application will display on a google map API library to
display the current locations of wildfires. These wildfires will range within the current year and will display information about each wildfire throughout
the world. This application is used to help people understand where wildfires have occured throughout the world.
